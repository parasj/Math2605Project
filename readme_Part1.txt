1. lu_fact:
	To test the lu_fact, run driver_lu_fact in the Matlab shell.

	It will launch a file picker for an input .dat file and print L, U and the LU error out to the Matlab shell.

	The lu_fact function takes in a Matlab matrix as an argument if you wish to test it directly.

2. qr_fact:
	To test qr_fact_househ and qr_fact_givens, run driver_qr_fact in the Matlab shell. This driver lets you choose which method you wish to solve with

	It will launch a file picker for an input .dat file. After that, it will ask for whether you wish to use householders or givens so calculate the QR decomposition. Press 1 to use the householders method and press 2 to use the givens method.
	It will then print L, U and the LU error out to the Matlab shell.

	The qr_fact function takes in a Matlab matrix as an argument if you wish to test it directly.
